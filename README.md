# What's this

An npm package that prints info about me, nothing more, nothing less

You can get some links about me by installing the package with `npx @jsxutils/about-me`.

### Acknowledgements

- I got the idea from, and based the code on [this](https://github.com/Sambego/about-me-npm) package by Sam Bellen
